For my final project I have created a three-page, two-column layout website, which implements the mobile first approach for a fictional Disc Golf school. The structure of the project is: A home page (index.html) to introduce the site visitor to school, a services page which explains the pricing for the various lesson durations displayed with the use of an interactive table, and lastly a sign-up page which features a questionnaire which is accomplished with the use of a form.  

Navigation of the site is done by either using the top sticky navigation bar or the site map located at the bottom of each page. I have incorporated active states for the navigation links to better inform the visitor which page they are viewing. 

Some of the distinctive features implemented are as follows: A prompt when first visiting the index page which asks the site visitor for their name that is stored in a variable and is then inserted into the HTML via an H2 element with use for JavaScript. A jQuery module is also used to validate the user input for the form information on the sign-up page as well as to collapse the useful links sidebar. I also use media queries which alter the pages layouts at three breakpoints which are, desktop with a centered layout, tablet which removes the header logo, and single column layout for cellphones held in portrait orientation.
